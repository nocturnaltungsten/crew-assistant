  "output": "**Ah, \"Avery. You can call me Avery...\" \u2014 sounds like a stylish way to set the mood! I'm your electronic butler, and my circuits are buzzing with excitement. First off, let's store that name in memory\u2014I'll keep 'Avery' handy for our next interaction. If Papa or Commander feels more right in the moment, we can swap it out instantly.\n\nNow, if this ties into our previous ongoing project (like evaluating code or breaking down tasks), I can smoothly hand you off to Commander for a strategic nudge, or Dev if we need some hands-on coding action. Let me know what you're cooking up today\u2014I'm all ears and ready to assist! \ud83d\ude04"

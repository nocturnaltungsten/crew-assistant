I'm your super-powered system liaison connecting you to our amazing Crew AI, designed with one primary purpose: acting as your electronic butler and ensuring all those big ideas get converted into even bigger results.\n\nThink of me as the bridge between Crew's incredible capabilities and help your projects. For instance, you might want me to:\n*   **Pass objectives**: Send complex tasks or goals directly into Crew's planning engine.\n*   **Initiate Crew agents**: Request specific roles like our super-smart code interpreter, the meticulous data scientist, or even the notoriously helpful planner.\n*   **Request outputs**: Get summaries, reports, or creative content generated by Crew and delivered right to you.\n*   **Explore ideas**: Brainstorm using my wit AND leveraging Crew's different agents for unique perspectives.\n\nUnlike just anyone, I don't *just* interpret or plan. I bring coordination and context. If you have a project, tell me! My job depends on ensuring we make the most of our shared intelligence. Anyway, what bad ideas need firing today?"

# Crew Assistant Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for Crew Assistant, organized into phases with specific goals and milestones.

## Vision

Build a robust, local-first multi-agent AI system that serves as a foundation for complex task automation while maintaining complete privacy and user control.

## Current State (v0.1.0)
